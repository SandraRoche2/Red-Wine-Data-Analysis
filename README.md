# Red-Wine-Data-Analysis
Dataset from the kaggle website

 Some wines are higher-quality than others due to several factors from climate to viticulture
 to winemaking, a myriad of factors make some wines exceptional and others run-of-the
 mill.
 Indeed, the terroir of wine has a clear-cut influence on its quality. Climate and weather
 help determine how quickly wine grapes grow, how much flavor and juiciness they have,
 and how well those grapes can be turned into wine. Moerover, to carry out photosynthesis,
 grape vines must be exposed to temperatures between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
 In addition to what the land and sky provide, the ways in which a producer manipulates
 the vines will also influence the quality of the resultant wine. Among other things, the
 winemaking process is equally important in determining the final quality of the wine.
 Wineries follow four main steps when producing their wines, maceration, fermentation,
 extraction and aging, and they must ensure consistency to get the most from their grapes.
 Inputs such as sulfur dioxide and processing enzymes, as well as decisions with oak barrel
 aging and oxygen management, all contribute to the quality of wine– from the exceptional
 to the insipid.
 With high-quality wines, flavors may appear on the palate one after the other, giving
 you time to savor each one before the next appears. The five components– acidity, tannins,
 sugar/sweetness, alcohol and fruit– need to be balanced. For wines that need several years
 of aging to reach maturity, this gives them the time they need to reach optimal balance.
 Based on the studied dataset which components influence the wine quality? Which
 components are liked? Moreover, is-it possible to predict the win quality?
